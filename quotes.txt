Where there is no desire, there will be no industry.

Waste not fresh tears over old griefs.

Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words.

We never know the worth of water till the well is dry.

Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.

Never leave that 'till tomorrow which you can do today.

An optimist is the human personification of spring.

While there's life, there's hope.

It is a bad plan that admits of no modification.

Well done is better than well said.
